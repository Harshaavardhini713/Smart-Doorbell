# Smart Doorbell

In our Smart Doorbell system, Raspberry pi V4 and raspberry pi camera module is used to identify the visitor’s face using facial recognition. When the doorbell is pressed by the visitor, their photograph is taken. The photograph and the name of the visitor if recognized is sent to the owner via an email. The data about when the doorbell is pressed is also sent to thingspeak cloud server. This data is used to send an SMS alert to the owner’s phone number with time at which the bell was rung through IFTTT applet.
